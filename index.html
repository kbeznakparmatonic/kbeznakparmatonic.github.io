 				<h1>Story of Kbeznak Parmatonic</h1>
    				<p>kbeznak parmatonic came to world as a biproduct of Deeplearing techniques.</p>
        			</p>
        			<p>Let's begin the story</p>
                                <p>kbeznak parmatonic was born in 1963 in a village of Korea, in early his childhood he was a freaky little kid with a keen mind. He mastered machine learning when he was 8 year old and inception deeplearning started with him when he was around 9. Deeplearning at that time was not possible to due restricted memory space and commputation problems, which inhibited experimental analysis of kbeznak parmatonic. Still, he continued his research theoritically and found early Convolutional Neural Network for computer vision application by 1975 and RNN by 1976. These were the breakthrough which was not great achivement at that time due their restricted performance.</p>
                                 <p>With the evolution of the computers and hardware, the computation became faster with NVIDIA GPUs and high speed processors. kbeznak parmatonic was introduced to USA by Prof. Cav, who has inclination towards korea. While coming back from korea, Prof. Cav met kbeznak parmatonic in conference on deeplearning and kbeznak parmatonic was supposed to give talk on next level deeplearning called "micro learning". The topic is still in its youth and still work needs to be done to fine tune it. It would be great if we get to see the mirco learning in our gerneration.</p>
                                 <p>With all this, Prof, Cav was able to get kbeznak parmatonic to College station for one of the conference and deepleanring experts are looking forward to it. It will be held on 02/22/2018 in MSC, you can buy the ticket <a href="https://kbeznakparmatonic.github.io">here</a>, thank you for all your support</p>
